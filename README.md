A bot made to help automate investigations during Danganronpa RPs.

A niche use, but it comes in use because doing it manually takes quite a bit of time.

The bot relies on a user to find out a 'key word' in order to actually get the Truth Bullet. It's up to the people who use this to hint at the key words.

Setup instructions may come sooner or later.

If you wish to invite the bot, join the Support Server linked below and DM me. Can't let the thing grow exponentially.

Environment vars: `MAIN_TOKEN`, `DIRECTORY_OF_FILE`, `LOG_FILE_PATH`, `JISHAKU_NO_UNDERSCORE=true` (last one is optional).
